# Variadic futures

Variadic, completion-based futures for C++17.

## Why?

In short, I need this to properly implement [another project](https://github.com/FrancoisChabot/easy_grpc) of mine, and it was an interesting exercise.

More specifically, completion-based futures are a non-blocking, callback-based, synchronization mechanism that hides the callback logic from the asynchronous code, while properly handling error conditions. 

## But why variadic?

Because it allows for the `tie()` function, which provides a very nice way to asynchronously wait on multiple futures at once:

```
Future<void> foo() {
  Future<int> fut_a = ...;
  Future<bool> fut_b = ...;
 
  Future<int, bool> combined_fut = tie(fut_a, fut_b);
 
  Future<void> result = combined_fut.then([](int a, bool b) {
    // This is called once both fut_a and fut_b have been successfully completed.
    std::cout << a << " - " << b;
  });
  
  // If either fut_a or fut_b fails, the result will contain that failure.
  return result;
}
```

## Installation

* Make the contents of the include directory available to your project.
* Have a look at `var_future/config.h` and make changes as needed.
* If you are from the future, you may want to use `std::expected` instead of `expected_lite`,

## Documentation

The main header `var_future/future.h` is meant to contain all of the user-facing interface, and nothing but the user-facing interface. It serves directly as the main documentation (for now).

## Usage
### Prerequisites

I am assuming you are already familiar with the [expected<>](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0323r7.html) concept/syntax.

### Basic

```cpp

#include "var_future/future.h"

void foo() {
  aom::Promise<int> prom;
  {
    aom::Future<int> fut = prom.get_future();
  
    fut.then_finally_expect([](aom::expected<int> v){
      // Do something with v;
      // This is called in whichever thread fullfills the future.
    });
  }
  
  // some time later, perhaps in another thread.
  prom.set_value(2);
}
```

Note that it does not matter that the future is destroyed after the callback is bound. The callback, and its bindings will be kept around until the promise is fullfilled, failed or destroyed.

### Tieing futures

You can wait on multiple futures at the same time using the `tie()` function.

```cpp

#include "var_future/future.h"

void foo() {
  aom::Promise<int> prom_a;
  aom::Promise<int> prom_b;

  //... Launch something that eventually fullfills the promises.

  aom::Future<int, int> combined = tie(prom_a.get_future(), prom_b.get_future());

  combined.then_finally_expect([](aom::expected<int> a, aom::expected<int> b){
    //Do something with a and/or b;
  });
}
```

## Choosing where the callback executes

This example shows how to use [ASIO](https://think-async.com/Asio/), but the same idea can be applied to other contexts easily.

```cpp
#include "asio.hpp"
#include "var_future/future.h"

// This can be any type that has a thread-safe push(Callable<void()>); method
struct Work_queue {
  template<typename T>
  void push(T&& cb) {
    asio::post(ctx_, std::forward<T>(cb));
  }

  asio::io_context& ctx_;
};

void foo() {
  asio::io_context io_ctx;
  Work_queue asio_adapter{io_ctx};

  aom::Promise<int> prom;
  aom::Future<int> fut = prom.get_future();

  // push the execution of this callback in io_context when ready.
  fut.then_finally_expect([](aom::expected<int> v) {
    //Do something with v;
  }, asio_adapter);
}
```

## Chaining Futures

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <chrono>

#include "var_future/future.h"

// This can be any type that has a thread-safe push(Callable<void()>); method
Work_queue main_work_queue;

std::Future<int> complete(std::string str) {
   aom::Promise<int> p;
   auto result = p.get_future();
   
   std::async(std::launch::async, [str, p=std::move(p)] mutable { 
      std::cout << str ;
      p.set_value(4); 
   });
   
   return result;
}

void foo() {
  aom::Promise<int> prom;
  aom::Future<int> fut = prom.get_future();

  fut.then([](int v){
    return std::string("hi") + std::to_string(v);
  })
  .then(complete)
  .then_finally_expect([](aom::expected<int> v) {
    //Do something with v;
  }, main_work_queue);
}
```

## Reference

### Glossary

* **Fullfilled** every member of the future has a value assigned to it.
* **Finished** every member of the future has either a value or an error assigned to it.
  * A future finished with nothing but values is considered both **fullfilled** and **finished**
  * A future finished with nothing but errors is considered both **failed** and **finished**
* **Failed** every member of the future has an error assigned to it

### Methods

**Future::then()**

Chaining callback with failure propagation.
```
[1] Future<U> Future<Ts...>::then(cb);
[2] Future<U> Future<Ts...>::then(cb, queue);
```
* `cb` is a `Callable<U(Ts...)>`
* [1] `cb` is immediately called when `this` is **fullfilled**.
* [2] `cb(...)` is pushed in queue when `this` is **fullfilled**.
* If `this` is failed, `cb` is NOT called
* If `sizeof...(Ts)>1` any failure causes the complete failure of the future.  
* The result Future will eventually contain either:
  * The value returned by `cb`
  * The error that caused `this` to fail
  * The exception thrown by `cb`

**Future::then_expect()**

Chaining callback.
```
[1] Future<U> Future<Ts...>::then_expect(cb);
[2] Future<U> Future<Ts...>::then_expect(cb, queue);
```

* `cb` is a `Callable<U(expected<Ts>...)>`
* [1] `cb` is immediately called when `this` is **finished**.
* [2] `cb(...)` is pushed in queue when `this` is **finished**.
* The result Future will eventually contain either:
  * The value returned by `cb`
  * The exception thrown by `cb`

**Future::then_finally_expect()**

Simple callback.
```
[1] Future<U> Future<Ts...>::then_finally_expect(cb);
[2] Future<U> Future<Ts...>::then_finally_expect(cb, queue);
```
* `cb` is a `Callable<U(expected<Ts>...)>`
* [1] `cb` is immediately called when `this` is **finished**.
* [2] `cb(...)` is pushed in queue when `this` is **finished**.

**Future::get_std_future()**

Bridge to `std` api.
```
[1] std::future<T> Future<T>::get_std_future();
[2] std::future<std::tuple<see_below>> Future<Ts...>::get_std_future();
```

* Returns a std::future<> that completes upon Future **finishing**
* if `sizeof...(Ts) > 1`, the resulting tuple will have the types of the non-void `Ts`.

**tie()**

Wait on multiple futures.
```
[1] Future<T,U,...> tie(Future<T>, Future<U>, ...);
```
* Returns a Future that is **finished** when all passed futures are **finished**
